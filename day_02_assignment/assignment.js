  Program to take input from command line and performs arithmetic operations
  
  Use process.argv to get the command line arguments.
  process.argv is an array of strings.
  Where,
    process.argv[0] is path of the node executable.
    process.argv[1] is path of the file that is being executed.(Currently Executed).
    process.argv[2] ... onwards all command line arguments each on new index.
  So, we used slicing on that array to remove first 2 elements.
  Now, check if used entered to parameters or not
  if not then error message
